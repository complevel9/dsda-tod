# dsda-tod
This is a fork of dsda-doom (v0.25.6) with some extra stuff.

Currently there's 2 new launch flags:
- `-tod` prints out the time of player death to stdout and immediately exits.
- `-mhrz` reduces red screen intensity.

Other new feature(s):
- `keyboard_display` HUD widget that displays keyboard input. Currently somewhat functional.
